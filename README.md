Old repository was here:

Current status- 
This application allows users to log accelerometer readings to a local SQLite database on the user's Android phone. 

Application stores last 4 acceleration values in a buffer and uses these values to compute jostle index (volume of the tetrahedron formed by the last 4 values)
